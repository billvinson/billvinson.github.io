Currently (the evening of 2023.02.17), Rotten Tomatoes has this movie sitting at a Tomatometer of 48%. That feels like an incredibly low percentage for a movie that I really enjoyed. That isn&amp;rsquo;t to say there aren&amp;rsquo;t issues to be had with this movie, but I found it to be lots of fun.</description></item><item><title>Stranger Things (Seasons 1-4)</title><link>https:/billvinson.github.io/blog/stranger-things/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https:/billvinson.github.io/blog/stranger-things/</guid><description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t subscribed to Netflix for a bit as I feel they are overpriced for the content they offer. However, while I was caught up on Stranger Things, my younger son, Ian, was keen to watch it with me. The first two seasons didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly concern me as he isn&amp;rsquo;t easily frightened, but each season gets a bit more dark (similar in that respect to the Harry Potter series) and with seasons 3 and 4, I feel they crank up the gore and scares (compared to previous seasons).</description></item><item><title>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</title><link>https:/billvinson.github.io/blog/wakanda-forever/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https:/billvinson.github.io/blog/wakanda-forever/</guid><description>I went to see Black Panther: Wakanda Forever last night with my younger son and we both enjoyed it. However, I think I enjoyed it more than he did as it is a slow burn of a blockbuster (there&amp;rsquo;s more dialog and less action set pieces or at least it felt that way). There is a large amount of attention to handling grief (rightly so). The loss of Chadwick Boseman weighs heavily on so much of this film.</description></item></channel></rss>
