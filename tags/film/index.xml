Currently (the evening of 2023.02.17), Rotten Tomatoes has this movie sitting at a Tomatometer of 48%. That feels like an incredibly low percentage for a movie that I really enjoyed. That isn&amp;rsquo;t to say there aren&amp;rsquo;t issues to be had with this movie, but I found it to be lots of fun.</description></item><item><title>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</title><link>https:/billvinson.github.io/blog/wakanda-forever/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https:/billvinson.github.io/blog/wakanda-forever/</guid><description>I went to see Black Panther: Wakanda Forever last night with my younger son and we both enjoyed it. However, I think I enjoyed it more than he did as it is a slow burn of a blockbuster (there&amp;rsquo;s more dialog and less action set pieces or at least it felt that way). There is a large amount of attention to handling grief (rightly so). The loss of Chadwick Boseman weighs heavily on so much of this film.</description></item></channel></rss>
