This is a collection of some improvements that I am hoping to see as part of WWDC 2022. Some are more likely than others, but they're all things I wish to be undertaken by Apple...

<!--more-->

# iOS/iPadOS

- Fix autoplay while in CarPlay
  - If I have my music/podcast paused and I try to browse anything (while parked) that has media on it, the music/podcast auto-resumes
  - I can find no way to prevent it without killing the music/podcast app
  - It is the bane of my existence üòÅ
- Messages Spam Filter
- Universal notifications ‚Äì notifications clear from all devices when read on one (Thanks to Juli Clover)
- Share ‚Äúsome‚Äù parts of Home app with other family members
  - My kids don‚Äôt need access to everything
- Interactive Widgets
  - Update widget details more often (Fitness is always way behind for me)
- Control Center API for third-party apps
- Photos
  - Family library
  - Allow for viewing/editing keywords
- Emoji zoom
  - Allow for a tap and hold to enlarge the emoji to make it easier to identify
- Allow for scheduling of full subscribed calendar refresh
  - Currently, it seems to refresh haphazardly or not at all in iOS/iPadOS

# macOS

- Fix Time Machine when using a NAS
  - It will work for some random amount of time (a day to a few weeks) and then just stop with no useful error logging
  - Regular use of the NAS still works at this point, but Time Machine seems to become permanently broken without deleting the backup and starting over‚Ä¶

# tvOS/Apple TV app

- Every piece of video content should display whether it is 4K, HD, SD, HDR, etc. on the details page consistently
- Allow for paid upgrades from HD to 4K
- Stop showing content that is already owned as ‚Äúun-purchased‚Äù when the content owner repackages it as ‚Äúnew‚Äù
  - At minimum, show me that I own a ‚Äúprevious version‚Äù of the title

{{% image-test %}}

- Metadata adjustment (title, genre, cover art)
  - Sometimes the metadata is just wrong, ugly or shows zero effort on the part of the content owner
